Your start  the game as a hero you do dungeons to get gear for you and your knights, get gold(currency) to run yout kingdown, get treasure(jewel encrusted crowns, rare objects etc) to increase your prestige among the people, you gain "XP" to increase your skills/strength. 
You use the power you gain from doing dungeons to found your town in the overworld and expand your town until you take over other towns and find yourself with a kingdom.
Other towns will be defending by their own soldiers  that you need to overcome with you and your knights as well as soldiers
In between twons there wil be weaker camps of human bandits or monsters (trolls, ogres etc) that you can conquer they will be more like the dungeon in terms of difficulty and loot, but they will not have actual towns for you to take over and they should require that you have at least a small army, also they will not be repeatedly "runnable"




- start the game as a "King Aurthur" type hero, which means you need to gain followers(knights) and with them you increase the power of your expanding kingdom.

- You have a main character  that is you, but you can also go on adventures with or AS your knightly followers

- skill trees:
	-death (summoning skeletons)
	-life (natural healing like elvish stuff maybe?)
	-elements (water, fire, earth, air)
	-holy (religious stuff, holy water to enchant your weapon)
	-some kind of aura tree (bard? command?)	

- The adventures are to gain loot, gold and gear that can drop like diablo 2 style

- crafing system??

- advenrures take place as dungeons similar to diablo 1 but you can choose the depth of the dungeon in order to do *runs* for loot and gold
	(only way to gain gold to pay your labourers?)

- you have a kingdom where the peasants farm to ensure everyone has food 
	(possibly other jobs, chopping trees, mining maybe?)

- recruit soldiers to defend your town by manning defensive locations and use them to expand and colonize other towns
	(overworld willl have alot more enemies, perhaps there will be a dirth of AoE spells and mostly single target abilities that makes the higher numbers but weaker enemies harder to fight without soldiers)

- Build buildings like an rts to expand your town
	Building list:
		-Houses & farms
		-Barracks
		-Keep
		-walls
		-Watchtowers
		-Church

-Conquer land in the overworld to take over other towns and garrison troops there to hold them and genocide the population but moving your own peasants there and outbreeding and displacing the locals, or just kill them





Bare minumum for a game:
	- simple overowlrd map
	- one cave style dungeon
	- a couple monsters to kill
	- simple aRPG combat system with slashing in from of your character and spells that can launch like skillshots
	- simple loot, sword, shield, body armour, with a couple item stats that are randomized(think rare items from diablo2)
	- buildings, farmhouse and barracks you can simply recruit from, you can't go inside them (not sure how to "recruit" peasants yet, maybe build the house and it comes with peasants that you can put to work)
	- a main character with basic stats & one skill tree, and inventory that can hold items and basic gear equipping that increases his stats
	- 2 followers with their owns skills that they can train up and gear
	- soldiers and peasants you can command
